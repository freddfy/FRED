Functional Reactive Event Driver - a lightweight Java library aims to facilitate writing asychronous event-driven systems by Functional Reactive Programming.

Functional Reactives
====
Java 8 comes with [CompletableFuture](http://download.java.net/lambda/b88/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html) and [Stream](http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/java/util/stream/Stream.html), which is great. But would it not be even nicer if we could have something that combines both, like the way in [Functional Reactive Programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming) which allows write functional style operations on one or more async streams.

Example Usage
====
[FunctionalReactives](https://github.com/freddfy/FRED/blob/master/src/main/java/fred/FunctionalReactives.java) is your friend to write [simple Java codes in a Functional Reactive style](https://github.com/freddfy/FRED/blob/master/src/test/java/fred/example/FunctionalReactiveExamples.java). (and it's on Java 6!)
