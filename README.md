Functional Reactive Event Driver - a lightweight Java library aims to facilitate writing asychronous event-driven systems by Functional Reactive Programming.

Functional Reactives

Would not it be nice if we could construct not only a one-time [Future](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/Future.html) but a series of callbacks? - So it comes [Reactive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactive_programming).

Would not it be even nicer if we could handle a stream of callbacks like a [Stream](http://download.java.net/jdk8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html) that allows for Functional-style operations? - And then it comes [Functional Reactive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_reactive_programming).

Example Usage
====
[FunctionalReactives](https://github.com/freddfy/FRED/blob/master/src/test/java/fred/example/FunctionalReactiveExamples.java) is what you got to write easy Java codes in a Functional Reactive style.
